//The thinking being that if it is some focus stealing script on a remote page that you can't control, the browser won't focus a hidden element. And there's a good //likelihood that your onload will fire after their focus changing script.

// Or, one other option that might be a bit more reliable:

<iframe style="position: absolute; top: -9999em; visibility: hidden;" onload="this.style.position='static'; this.style.visibility='visible';" src="..."></iframe>

//Here we're basically saying hiding the frame and moving it to a negative offset on the page vertically. When it does try to focus the element inside of the frame, //it should scroll the page upward, then once loaded place the iframe back in it's intended position.
